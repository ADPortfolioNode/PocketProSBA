# RENDER.COM DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
# Rust Compilation Issue Workaround

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Render.com build failing due to Rust compilation errors when installing chromadb.
Error: "Read-only file system (os error 30)" - maturin/cargo build fails.

## SOLUTION: MINIMAL DEPLOYMENT APPROACH

### Phase 1: Get Core App Running (Current Focus)
‚úÖ Use requirements-render-minimal.txt
‚úÖ Excludes packages that require Rust compilation:
   - chromadb (temporarily removed)
   - sentence-transformers (heavy dependency)

### Phase 2: Add ChromaDB Later (Future Enhancement)
- Once core app is deployed and stable
- Explore alternatives:
  1. Use Render.com's native PostgreSQL with pgvector
  2. Use external ChromaDB service
  3. Try different vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate)

## FILES UPDATED:
üìù requirements-render-minimal.txt - Created minimal dependency list
üìù render.yaml - Updated to use minimal requirements

## APP BEHAVIOR WITH MINIMAL SETUP:
‚úÖ Flask API will start successfully
‚úÖ Health endpoints will work
‚úÖ Basic LLM functionality will work (Google Gemini)
‚úÖ Document upload endpoints exist but ChromaDB operations return graceful errors
‚úÖ App logs will show "ChromaDB not available - skipping..." for vector operations

## BENEFITS:
- App deploys successfully on Render.com
- Core functionality works
- No Rust compilation issues
- Can add vector database functionality later
- Faster builds and deployments

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Deploy with minimal requirements
2. Verify basic functionality
3. Gradually add more features once stable
